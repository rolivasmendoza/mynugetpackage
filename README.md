# mynugetpackage
Syncfusion's Coding Cube NuGet package pushing example.

This project is a base line for creating NuGet packages and pushing automatically using a T4 template.

You need to download the T4 Executer Visual Studio extension, using the Manage Extensions option from the Extensions menu, for running the template just after the project is built.
You should review the BuildNuGetPackage.tt file in NuGetBuilder folder, in order to understand how the automatic process is done.

For going deep into T4 templates, I suggest you to download T4 Succinctly e-book written by Nick Harrison, from https://www.syncfusion.com/ebooks/t4succinctly
